I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a relentless curiosity for breaking and defending systems.. My cybersecurity journey began by diving into the  world of offensive security—solving CTF challenges, exploiting vulnerabilities. But true security isn’t just about breaking in; it’s about keeping threats out. This realization drove me to enterprise security operations, where I applied my offensive knowledge to threat detection, SIEM monitoring, and incident response. Now I bridge both worlds: thinking like an attacker to build better defenses.

## Objective


I’m now pursuing a career in cybersecurity with roles that leverage this dual perspective.
